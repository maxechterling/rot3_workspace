Installation procedure for Network3:

If configure script does not exist (developers only):
0) autoreconf --no-recursive --install

To configure compile and install Network3 (all users):
1) ./configure --prefix=BNGPATH --disable-shared
2) make
3) make install

The run_network binary will be placed at BNGPATH/bin/.
Note the BNGPATH must specify the absolute path.

To validate BioNetGen installation:
0) if NFsim validation is desired, place NFsim binary (or symbolic link)
   in the folder BNGPATH/bin/.
1) run the Perl script BNGPATH/Validate/validate_examples.pl.
2) if any tests fail, look at the log files for more information.

PLEASE NOTE: Stochastic simulation tests rely on statistical validation.
Occasionally a validation will fail due to outliers. Run the validation
script a few times. If a test passes most of the time, it is probably OK.
Single tests may be run by passing the model basename as argument.
